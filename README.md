#Crypto Now

This is a UWP windows project built for the purposes of studying and learning. 

The application pulls web services from https://api.CoinMarketCap.com for the grid and coin details, and from https://api.Blockchain.info to populate the latest crypto-currency price information.

##Getting Started

The project was build in Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition and is built for Windows 10

###Prerequisites
There is no installer so you will need a Windows 10 system with Visual Studio to run the application. The application references Mvvm Light and Newtonsoft.Json libraries.

###Documentation
There is a menu system at the top to navigate between the three views of the data. The opening tab is a shameless plug of my website.
